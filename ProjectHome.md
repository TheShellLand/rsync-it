This little project of mine started with the fascination of how well rsync worked for me. Rsync became the tool that I used to copy, move, and synchronize directories and files between servers over the Internet or on my local network. I started shell scripting just over a couple months ago, in May. Instead of studying for a biochemistry final, I researched how to write a shell script. And eight hours later I wrote my first program. That project can be found under one of my other projects that I created. It was simple. It had a menu system. It had a memory system that stored your previous inputs. Most of all, it worked. Ever since then I've been progressively increasing my knowledge on creating more effective and efficient coding methods. My code became shorter, comments more useful (to me when going back and reading what I have done), and felt more 'educated.' I've decided to open up this project as more of a journal to log the growth of my code and the growth of myself. This will let me look back to see where I was when I started to where I am presently.


TL;DR I'm using shell scripting to create something awesome with rsync.
